    "context": "Suffering (Pāli: दुक्ख dukkha; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha) is also a central concept in Buddhism. The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness, sorrow, affliction, anxiety, dissatisfaction, discomfort, anguish, stress, misery, and frustration. Although the term is often translated as \"suffering\", its philosophical meaning is more analogous to \"disquietude\" as in the condition of being disturbed. As such, \"suffering\" is too narrow a translation with \"negative emotional connotations\"[web 9] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic, but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic. In English-language Buddhist literature translated from Pāli, \"dukkha\" is often left untranslated, so as to encompass its full range of meaning.[note 8]\n",
